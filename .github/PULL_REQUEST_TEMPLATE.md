Please:
- [ ] Make your pull request atomic, fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled.
- [ ] Make lint and test pass. (Run `npm run lint` and `npm run test`.)
- [ ] Make sure you have rebased to the latest `master`.
- [ ] Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note.
  - Use imperative mood and present tense.
  - Mention relevant issues. (e.g., `#1`)
